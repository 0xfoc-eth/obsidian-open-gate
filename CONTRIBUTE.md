## Functional programming

Many times, I found myself trying to reuse some of the functions that I wrote in other projects. I found that the best way to do this is to write pure functions. Pure functions are functions that do not have any side effects and always return the same output for the same input. This makes them very easy to test and reuse.

A lot of function in this project are copied from another project.

Even thought JavaScript is not a functional programming language, I tried to write as much pure functions as possible. So, please keep this in mind when you are contributing to this project.

Thanks for your contribution!

## Git commit message

I prefer to use the AngularJS Git Commit Message Conventions, but it's optional. Nowerdays, we use AI to generate the changelog, message, so it's not that important anymore. But do not get me wrong, I still think that it's a good practice to use it.

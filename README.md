### Linking to Gates from Notes

You can also open a new Gate from within a note. By using the `obsidian://opengate` protocol.

#### Open pre-configured Gate

You can use a link in your notes to open a configured UI Gate and optionally open a specific URL in that Gate.

By default, the plugin will find the first Gate that matches the title or URL provided.

```markdown
Example 1: Open the Gate with a title of "googledocs".
Will simply open the gate as configured.

[Open Google Gate](obsidian://opengate?title=googledocs)

```

Sometime, you want to change the url of the configured gate. You can do that by adding `url` parameter to the link.

```markdown
Example 2: Open the Gate with a title of "googledocs" and go to a specific document.
Will navigate to the provided URL in the "googledocs" Gate.
Note: The original URL is: https://docs.google.com/document/d/abc123/edit but has been URL Encoded

[Open Google Gate](obsidian://opengate?title=google&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fdocument%2Fd%2Fabc123%2Fedit)
```

The gate will have them same configuration as the one you configured in the settings, but the url will be changed to the one you provided.

#### Open a temporary Gate [UNDER DEVELOPMENT]

If no Gate is found, the plugin will open a temporary Gate with the provided URL, this gate will not be saved and will be deleted when you close it.

```markdown
Example 1: Open the Gate with a title of "googledocs".
Will simply open the gate as configured.

[Open Google Gate](obsidian://opengate?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fdocument%2Fd%2Fabc123%2Fedit&profileKey=googledocs)
```

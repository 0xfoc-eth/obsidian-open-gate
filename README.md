### Linking to Gates from Notes

You can use a link in your notes to open a configured UI Gate and optionally open a specific URL in that Gate.

The `title` must match the title set for the gate in settings.

If you provide a `url`, it must be url encoded using a tool like https://www.urlencoder.org.

Example 1: Open the Gate with a title of "googledocs".
Will simply open the gate as configured.

[Open Google Gate](obsidian://opengate?title=googledocs)
```

```markdown
Example 2: Open the Gate with a title of "googledocs" and go to a specific document.
Will navigate to the provided URL in the "googledocs" Gate.
Note: The original URL is: https://docs.google.com/document/d/abc123/edit but has been URL Encoded

[Open Google Gate](obsidian://opengate?title=google&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fdocument%2Fd%2Fabc123%2Fedit)
